If a representative changes during the tournament, the tournament officials must be notified.

## Parties

### Teams and players

Teams are defined as a set number of players who participate as a group in the tournament.
LAN players who have registered for the tournament and who are eligible to participate are designated as players.

* Substitute players may be used when one player in the team is unable to play.
* Tournament officials must approve the use of a substitute player prior to them joining the tournament.
* All involved parties in the tournament will be notified via the main communication channel when a substitute player is used.

### Tournament Admins

### Head of tournaments

The head of tournaments holds the final decision power over any and all matters in all tournaments.

## During the tournament

### Schedule

Participants must check the published schedule regularly in case of adjustments, to ensure that the tournament is not delayed.

### Tournament check in

All team members must check in prior to the start of the tournament (as in start of the first round) on the designated tournament platform.

Failure to do this up to latest 20 minutes prior to the start of a tournament results in a disqualification.

### Match check in

The team captain must check in to the match on the designated tournament platform no later than 15 minutes after the start of the round according to the schedule.

If your opponent misses the check-in time window, notify the tournament officials. They will make a last attempt to contact them. If they cannot be contacted within a reasonable timeframe, the reporting team gets a defwin.

If both parties don't check in, or give any other indication that they are playing, the tournament official will give a defwin to a random team.

### Delayed match start

A match may be delayed if both teams agree to a set starting time.
This must be within reason and participants must guarantee that there is no risk of schedule delays.

Tournament officials must approve this delay and may decide a winner at random if the match is not finished by the end of the round.

### Pausing / Breaks Matches

If a break is longer than 5 minutes, the tournament official must be notified.

### Disconnects / Lag / Bugs

In case of a disconnect, lag, or major bug, the match can be paused for a duration of up to 15 minutes.

If the issue repeats, the tournament official must be notified.

### Medical Issues

In case of medical issues, the match must be paused.

The tournament officials must be informed and will make the decision if the match can continue.

### Price Ceremony

At-least one player or coach must be present on-site during the price ceremony to receive the price.

Ideally the entire team should be present.

## Conflict Resolution

### Match Issue

If an issue arises during the tournament, you must contact tournament officials.

Please provide any proof, such as screenshots, chats, etc., that are related to the issue.

### Decision Issue

In case of disagreement with a decision, the team representative may appeal to the head of tournaments.
