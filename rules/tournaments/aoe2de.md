### Qualification Swiss System

In the Swiss-System tournament, there will be a total of four rounds played.
After each round, game pairings will be adjusted based on the current player rankings.
These rankings are determined by considering the number of games won and lost by each player.
Once the four rounds are completed, the top eight players in the rankings will advance to compete for the tournament
victory. In the event of a tie for the eighth place after the four rounds, the ranking will be automatically calculated
to determine the final eight participants.

### Map Selection Process

#### Swiss Rounds

The last named player can pick the map.

#### Single Elimination

In a best-of-1 match, the lower seeded player chooses the map.
In a best-of-3 match, the first game is always played on Arabia.
Afterward the loser of the previously played game chooses the map.

## Civilization Draft

Players may pick any civilization, but may not repeat any civilization in a match.
This means that if, for example, a match lasts for three games, players will have played three different civilizations
each (also known as "hidden pick, no repeat").

## Playing Situations

### Disconnect or Game Crash

The player remaining in the game should save the game.
The game should then be restored to the last available point in time.

### End of Game

The winner is the player who has the most points after 700 years (60 in-game minutes).
Of course, a player also wins if the opponent surrenders prior to the time limit.
