# osu!

## General Provisions

These rules inherit all rules from the main rulebook.

These rules apply to all participants of the osu! tournament (hereinafter "osu" or "Game").

The rules may be available in several languages. If the individual versions differ, the English version is considered the correct version.

## Tournament Information

### Entry Restrictions

There are no rank restrictions for LAN tournaments unless specified. Map selectors and organizers are not allowed to participate in the tournament.

### Tournament format
This year's osu! Switzerlan tourney will be played in a 1v1 format. Players will sign up through the Switzerlan website. This tournament will be played on osu!stable client using score v2.

### Qualifiers
The tournament starts with a qualifier system. The players will play in self-reffed lobbies. Each player must create their own lobby according to the "Lobby Settings" section. Upon entering the lobby, the player must immediately send their match link to a tournament administrator. The match link can be seen in the chat when you create the multiplayer lobby.

The advancing players will be determined by adding the combined normalized scores across the qualifier pool and comparing them to the other players'. The top 16 players will advance.
Players will be only be allowed a single playthrough of the mappool. The qualifier lobbies must be finished by 21:30.

#### Map Rules

Once started, the map must be played until the end. The qualifier score of a map is determined by the scores submitted to the /mp/ link. A playerâ€™s score is counted as long as they do not quit during the map. If a map is played on the wrong settings e.g. wrong mod or score system, it will be replayed.

### Bracket

The tournament continues in a double-elimination format. Players who lose a match continue playing in the loser's bracket. Participants who lose a match in the loser's bracket will be eliminated from the tournament.

After both brackets have concluded, the winners of the two brackets compete in the grand finals at the Herofest osu! booth. If the player coming from the losers' bracket wins, an additional match will be played. However, if the player from the winner's bracket wins, they win the tournament.

Map pool size, match length, and the number of bans for each round are as follows:

| Round        | Size    | Best of | Ban #   |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Qualifier    | 12 maps | /       | /       | 
| Ro16/8, L1-2 | 15 maps | 9       | 1       |
| Ro4/2, L3-6  | 19 maps | 11      | 2       |
| Grand Finals | 22 maps | 13      | 2       |

#### Mappool

The mappool will be available on Tuesday the 22nd of September. The tournament sheet will be posted in the official discord channels.

The freemod pool allows the player to pick hidden, hardrock, or both mods unless specified otherwise. Additional score granted by the mod multipliers will count. 

In the forcedmod pools such as EZ, HD, HR, and DT, players are **not** allowed to pick additional mods.

#### Tiebreaker

In the event of a tiebreaker, players will have to play the tiebreaker map. The winner of which goes on to win the match. The rules of the freemod pool also apply to the tiebreaker.

### Match procedures

#### Lobby Creation

Players create their own lobbies according to the "Lobby Settings" section. This tournament will be fully self-reffed until the Grand Finals.

#### Roll and warmups (Brackets only)

At the beginning of the match, each player executes a !roll command.

The player with the highest roll points will have their warmup played first. Warmups may not be longer than four minutes and may not contain questionable or offensive material of any kind. Players are free to choose mods when playing a warmup map. 

Bans will follow an ABBA order when applicable.

The roll winner chooses the pick order, and the roll loser the ban order.

#### Picks

Double picks are **NOT** allowed, meaning you cannot pick 2 maps from the same modpool in a row. For example, this is not allowed:

HD1 -> Opponent's pick -> HD3

The freemod pool is exempt from this rule.

Players will also have the option to force a mod onto the freemod pool for the whole lobby. This may be any of the following mods: nomod, hidden, hardrock, provided that they are not disallowed according to the mappool sheet. The amount of forced mod picks per player is as follows:

| Round        | Forcemod Picks|
|--------------|---------------|
| Ro16/8, L1-2 | 1             |
| Ro4/2, L3-6  | 1             |
| Grand Finals | 2             |

#### Bans

You are not allowed to ban two maps from the same modpool, e.g. HD1 and HD2. 

However, both players can choose to ban maps from the same modpool, e.g. Player 1 bans HR1 and Player 2 HR2.

#### Replays

In case a player disconnects during a map, the admins may allow a replay of the map.

#### Lobby behavior

Behavior during and between matches underlies the global osu! and [switzerLAN rules](https://rules.switzerlan.ch/). Players are expected to be respectful to staff and to each other during matches. In extreme cases, the tournament management may disqualify a player for excessive disruptions and rule violations.
