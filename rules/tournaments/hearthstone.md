## Game Settings

### Match Settings

The 1. named team (upper one in the Bracket) is responsible for creating the match lobby.

* Server: Europe
* Format: Bo5 Conquest (4 decks of different classes, 1 ban)

### Hero Banning

Each player brings **4 decks of different classes**.
At the beginning of each match, each player has to ban 1 deck from his opponent.
The banned deck may not be used.
If a player mistakenly picks the wrong deck and the opponent plays the game nonetheless, it means that he agreed to the "conditions" and may not complain to the tournament officials afterwards.

The deck lists will be submitted on Battlefy.
If a player is using a card which is not listed on his Battlefy’s list, his opponent may request the round win (so it would be 1-0 in the Bo5 for example).

### Banned Cards

* Dew Process

### Scripts / 3rd Party Software

It is not allowed to use any 3rd party software such as deck trackers or any other systems which are not directly provided by the game.

You may use a pen and paper to write down what your opponent has play though.
