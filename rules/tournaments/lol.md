# League of Legends

## General Provisions

These rules inherit all rules from the main rule book.

These rules apply to all participants of the League of Legends tournament (hereinafter "LoL" or "Game").

The rules may be available in several languages. If the individual versions differ, the English version is considered the source of the truth.

## Tournament Information

### Tournament Platform

The official tournament platform for this tournament is Battlefy.
Please make sure that each member of your team has an account.

The official tournament page will be shared via the main communication channel established in the main rule book.

### Tournament Format

The tournament is played in the following stages:

| Stage           | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swiss Rounds    | Swiss Rounds in Best-of-1 format. The top 16 teams advance to the Pro Qualifier, with the rest going into the Fun Elimination.                       |
| Pro Qualifier   | Best-of-3 single round between the top 16 teams (Seed 1 vs Seed 16, etc.). Winners advance to Pro Elimination, losers to Fun Elimination.            |
| Pro Elimination | Best-of-3 double-elimination bracket between the 8 qualified teams.                                                                                  |
| Fun Elimination | Best-of-1 single-elimination 64-team bracket for all remaining teams, switching to Best-of-3 from Quarter Finals onwards (including Quarter Finals). |

### Side Selection

#### Swiss Rounds

Side selection is awarded to the team listed first in the match pairing.

#### Playoffs

Side selection will be awarded to the higher seed for game 1. For all games after the first, the losing team of the previous game will have side selection.

### Tiebreaker

To minimize the amount of tiebreakers, the Swiss Rounds will be:

- 45 teams or fewer: 6 rounds
- 46 teams or more: 7 rounds

The tiebreakers of the Swiss Rounds will use the following stack:

- Median Buchholz Score
- Buchholz Score
- Progressive Score
- Head-to-Head (only two-way)
- Play-in (on trigger only)

Each criterion is applied in order; if teams remain tied, the next criterion is used. If all criteria fail to separate the tie, the play-in rule below applies.

**Extra play-in round (only for perfect ties at the Pro Qualifier cut)**:
We run a one-round play-in only if, after Swiss, a group of â‰¥4 teams is tied on the cut with identical Median Buchholz, Buchholz, and Progressive (H2H not applicable) and the group size exceeds the remaining Pro berths. Let B be the number of berths left. We randomly select 2B teams from the tied group to play B Bo1 matches in parallel; winners take the berths. If fewer than 2B teams are tied, byes are assigned at random to ensure B winners. Otherwise, published tiebreakers decide without an extra round.
If required, the extra decider round will begin at 09:00 on Saturday, directly before the Pro Qualifier. All matches are played in parallel. Given the format, this is unlikely.

If three or fewer teams are tied for the final berth with identical tiebreakers, and all criteria above fail to separate them, the berth will be awarded by random draw.
