At the start of each overtime, teams will stay on the side from which they played the previous half - during half-time sides will be swapped. Teams will continue to play overtimes until a winner has been found.\nMatch Server # Matches are played on servers provided by Admins and will be Online Server Hosted in Bern Playoffs might have Local Servers depending on the Setup. Teams are required to check all necessary game aspects (including skins, bugs on load etc.) and network components (latency and server variance) no later than 5 minutes before the scheduled match start. Failure to do so, and to let the match start, will mean that both teams have accepted the state the map and server is in, and the match might be continued under these conditions.\nIn-game Chat # Usage of the in-game chat during the match is limited to communication with the tournament administration only. Any sort of advertisement or unrelated comments are not allowed before or after the match. Penalties may be applied if the in-game chat function is used to the goal of annoying the opponent or interrupting the flow of play. Pre-match communication with opponents is only allowed in a respectful manner.\nCoaching # Participants are allowed to have their registered coach behind them during their official matches. During the match, the coach will be connected to the voice communication system and will only be allowed to talk to the players during tactical pauses and half times. The coach is not allowed to communicate in any other way including, but not limited to, shouting or non-verbal communication (e.g. touching) with players outside of the specified time windows. Any coach found to be in breach of the communications restrictions outlined in this section will receive one (1) warning from the referees. This warning stays in place for the duration of the event. If this rule is breached again, or the first instance is severe enough, the coach will be ejected from the game and forfeits their right to coach for the remainder of the match. The administration team will pause the match for the duration of the removal and this pause is considered to be equal to a technical pause for communication purposes. Teams may be given a preemptive warning in case they are considered repeat offenders. In case of a preemptive warning, the first incident will result in the coach being ejected. An ejected coach cannot be replaced via the coach substitution. Warnings are logged by the tournament administration and may be reviewed for sanctioning purposes. If the incident has clearly and relevantly impacted the game, the consequences for the coach and/or the team will be accordingly more severe.\nUsage of Pause Function # The Pause function can be used at any time, but it will only come into effect during freeze time (immediately if used during freeze time, else at the beginning of the next freeze time).\nTechnical Pause # If a participant has a problem that prevents them from playing on, they are allowed to use the pause function . The technical pause function can be called by typing “.tech/!tech”. The participant has to announce the reason for the pause before or immediately after they paused the match. During a technical pause, headsets have to stay on. Unless the tournament administration specifically instructs the participants otherwise, any form of communication including, but not limited to, text, voice or any form of non-verbal communication between players and coaches is strictly forbidden during a technical pause.\nTimeout # Each participant is allowed to invoke a timeout of thirty (30) seconds up to three (3) times in regulation rounds per map. Timeouts can be called by participants via the in-game vote system (ESC → Call Vote → Call Tactical Timeout). Participants are allowed to take all three timeouts at once by calling them all individually once the previous timeout expires. If a map reaches overtime (OT), all remaining timeouts will be removed and each team will receive one (1) timeout to be used in that OT (OT1) period. If the map progresses to another OT (OT2), the same process will happen - any remaining timeouts will be removed and each team will receive one (1) more timeout. Banked timeouts cannot be stacked higher than one (1) in overtime.\nTournament Administration Pause # The tournament administration can pause the game from their station, or from a participant station, when it is required. Communication is only allowed with the tournament administration.\nPlayer Settings # Configuration Files # All configuration changes are allowed as long as they do not give an unfair advantage comparable to cheating. A player or team may be penalised for disallowed settings in any config file, regardless of if it is in use, or even stored in the game folder in question. Participants are required to contact the tournament administration if they are unsure on the validity of a command and its value.\nScripts # All scripts are strictly prohibited, with no exceptions. This includes any in-game binds that execute more than one movement and/or attack action. Participants may be penalised for forbidden scripts in any config file, regardless of if it is in use, or even stored in the game folder in question. Buying scripts is the exception.\nGraphics Drivers # Any modification or changing of the game using external graphics solutions or other 3rd party programs are strictly prohibited and may be punished as cheating.\nOverlays # All kinds of overlays which will show the usage rate of the system in any way in-game (e.g. Discord overlay, Rivatuner Overlay) are forbidden. Overlays which show only the frames per second (FPS) are not forbidden and can be used.\nCustom Data # Players are not allowed to use any form of custom game files during their official matches. Counter-Strike skins are allowed to be changed, but “Agent” player skins are forbidden. Any other changes including, but not limited to, modification of sprites, radars, HUDs and scoreboards are strictly forbidden.\nDevice Drivers # Using device drivers to pre-install/pre-script illegal macros on the participant’s devices (keyboards, mice, sound cards) is forbidden and may be punished as cheating.\nIn-game Items # All in-game items, including skins, nametags, and stickers (or any combination of stickers), must fully comply with the code of conduct and contain no racism, homophobic or other content that may cause harm.\nMatch procedures # Match breaks # Participants will have at least a 15 minute break between matches and 10 minutes between maps in a best of three (Bo3) match. The exact length of these breaks will be communicated by the tournament administration.\nNumber of players # All matches have to start with five players per team (5vs5), no other combinations are allowed. If a participant fails to show up with enough players, the match will be counted as a no-show. If a player disconnects during an ongoing round, the current round will be finished. If the map is not over at that point, the game should be paused until the player can return or be replaced by a substitute. If the original player is unable to return and no replacement can be brought in, the team has the choice to forfeit the series or to continue it with four players. If a participant would have to play on with less than four players, the opposing participant will receive a default win.\nMatch interruptions # If a match is interrupted for reasons beyond the control of the participants (e.g. server or player crash), the tournament administration will restore the round using Counter-Strike\u0026rsquo;s backup \u0026amp; restore feature, but in some scenarios, as detailed below, may decide to replay the round or even a whole match:\nIf the issue takes place before any damage or significant gameplay has occurred, and the opponent or referee has been immediately notified, the round will be restored. If the issue takes place during a round and after damage has been made, and the outcome of the round can still be determined (e.g. a single player has dropped but others remain), then the round will not be replayed or restored. The round will continue to be played and will count. Special exceptions can be made if the damage dealt was ruled insignificant e.g. accidental teammate damage dealt at the start of the round or if the damage dealt was by the team that was affected by the crash. If the issue takes place during the round, after damage has occurred and the outcome of the round cannot be determined (e.g. due to server crash), the match will be restored to the beginning of the round. If the issue takes place during the round, after damage has occurred and the outcome of the round is obvious (e.g. one team is saving with 10 seconds remaining), but it cannot be continued due to, for example, a server crash, then the round can be awarded to the team that was likely to win that round. Matches will not be stopped and/or rounds will not be restored or replayed in cases where it is clearly a participant\u0026rsquo;s fault (e.g. mis-buying a weapon). Use of bugs and glitches # The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game is forbidden. It is at the tournament administration’s discretion as to whether or not the use of said bugs had an effect on the match, and whether or not they will award rounds, or the match, to the opposing team, or if they will force a rematch. The usage of the following bugs is strictly forbidden:\nMoving through clipped areas where the movement is not intended by the design of the map (any walls, ceilings, floors etc). The bomb may not be planted in a location where it cannot be defused. Planting the bomb in such a way that no one can hear the beeping sound, or the planting sound. Pixel walking. A player is considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, where there is no visible edge. Disrupting any map features with the use of items (e.g. stopping the train on Overpass). It is recommended to check with tournament administration whether or not a certain bug or glitch is considered illegal. The following bugs are explicitly allowed:\nCovering the bomb with objects in the map or graffiti spray. Using graffiti spray to track the bomb timer\u0026hellip; Molotovs that spread through terrain. The tournament administration reserves the right, retroactively or otherwise, to add more bugs to the list of explicitly allowed bugs.\nNew positions # If any participant wants to use a new position which is not commonly known, it is strongly recommended to contact the tournament administration to check if that position is allowed before using it in any official match. Participants have to consider that it takes time to check new positions and therefore they have to contact tournament administration in a reasonable timeframe before an official match. An exhaustive list of allowed bugs \u0026amp; pixel walks will be maintained here.\nReconnecting # Participants are not allowed to reconnect during the live round. If they encounter a technical issue that requires a reconnect, they should pause the game, state the reason and only then reconnect. If a participant has crashed during the round, they should wait until the round is over and paused before reconnecting. Any breaches of this rule will result in at least one (1) penalty point being awarded. Joining the wrong team on the server when reconnecting is strictly forbidden.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/rules/hearthstone/","title":"Hearthstone","section":"Rules","content":" Hearthstone # General Provisions # These rules inherit all rules from the main rulebook.\nThese rules apply to all participants of the Hearthstone tournament (hereinafter \u0026ldquo;HS\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Game\u0026rdquo;).\nThe rules may be available in several languages.
